# Text_mining_project

## Summary


This study will examine different strategies that may improve the NPS comment filters and performance within X company. For this, different text mining techniques will be used, such as language identification, stemming, tokenization, data cleaning and the merging of two different csvs in order to find different keywords from one into the other. The study will use  NER and NEL. 

The Central Question in this research is: Could creating a csv file with different keywords while making use of the NLP,NER, NEL and Sentiment Analysis techniques in python improve the NPS comment filtering within the company?

The goal of the research is using knowledge and insight about text mining and different NLP techniques and creating  a strategy that can be used in future for filtering comments in the company. First, a literature review on text mining, artificial intelligence and different NLP techniques, then a strategy based on the knowledge collected is going to be devised and quantitatively examined by backtesting and live-testing in two main tasks from the company.

Text mining, or text analytics,  is known as an artificial intelligence (AI) technology that uses natural language processing (NLP) to transform unstructured text  from different sources (csv files, excel documents, websites, databases, etc) into  structured data suitable for analysis or to drive machine learning (ML) algorithms. 

In order to do so there will be used the following techniques: NER (Named entity recognition) which is referred to as an chunking, extraction, or identification entity which has as its main task to identify and categorize key information in text. Every detected key is classified into a predetermined category. Therefore, it will be possible to download into a csv different kinds of comments from Tableau. Afterwards, NER will be used in Python by having another csv file with the most important keywords, which consists of different tags for glasses or other products within the marketing department. Afterward, Python will be used to apply NEL (Named entity linking) and link and loop every keyword with all the rows from the comment. Afterwards, a sentiment analysis code will be created in order to filter positive, neutral or negative comments within any tag.  Finally, the information will be processed and connected with Tableau. Therefore it will be easier to filter multiple comments by specific tags and sentiments associated with it.
